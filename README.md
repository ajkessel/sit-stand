# sit-stand
A simple configurable sit-stand reminder script. My main purpose in writing this script was to learn more about PowerShell programming, but it has the added benefit of getting you to stand up regularly!

# execution
You can either run this as PS1 from Windows PowerShell or use the compiled EXE version.

# syntax
```
sitstand [options below, all options are, in fact, optional]
-sit [###] Time to sit before being remanded to stand in minutes (default 60)
-stand [###] Time to stand before being remanded to sit in minutes (default 60)
-font typeface in systray
-fg foreground color in systray
-bg background color in systray
-auto start automatically on login
-uninstall remove all traces of  application
-help Display  help message
```
